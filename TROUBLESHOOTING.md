# CountCraft Troubleshooting Guide

## Create Performance Button Not Working

### Problem
The "Create Performance" button was not working due to schema validation errors.

### Root Cause
The Zod schema validation in `src/lib/schema.ts` was expecting datetime strings for the `eventDate` field, but HTML date inputs provide date strings in "YYYY-MM-DD" format.

### Solution
Updated the schema validation to accept date strings instead of datetime strings:

**Before:**
```typescript
eventDate: z.string().datetime().optional().nullable(),
```

**After:**
```typescript
eventDate: z.string().optional().nullable(),
```

### Files Modified
- `src/lib/schema.ts` - Updated `CreatePerformanceSchema`, `UpdatePerformanceSchema`, and `BatchCreatePerformanceSchema`

### Testing
- API endpoint `/api/performances` now accepts POST requests with date strings
- Frontend form submission works correctly
- Database connection verified with Neon PostgreSQL

### Prevention
When using HTML date inputs with Zod validation, use `.string()` instead of `.string().datetime()` for date fields, as HTML date inputs provide date strings, not datetime strings.

## Audio File Upload Crashes

### Problem
The application crashes when users try to upload audio files.

### Root Cause
Multiple issues in the file upload process:
1. No error handling in `handleFileSelect` function
2. No file type validation
3. No file size limits
4. No error handling in Waveform component
5. Missing error handling for AudioContext operations

### Solution
Added comprehensive error handling and validation:

**File Upload Validation:**
- Added file type validation (audio files only)
- Added file size limit (50MB max)
- Added try-catch blocks around all async operations
- Added proper error messages with toast notifications
- Added state reset on errors

**Waveform Component:**
- Added try-catch blocks around WaveSurfer creation
- Added error event handlers
- Added proper cleanup error handling

### Files Modified
- `src/app/performance/[id]/page.tsx` - Enhanced `handleFileSelect` function
- `src/components/Waveform.tsx` - Added error handling

### Testing
- File upload now handles errors gracefully
- Users get clear error messages for invalid files
- Application no longer crashes on file upload errors
- Large files are rejected with appropriate messages

### Prevention
Always wrap async operations in try-catch blocks, validate user inputs, and provide clear error feedback to users.

## M4A File Support

### Problem
M4A files were not supported for upload and processing.

### Solution
Added comprehensive M4A file support:

**File Validation:**
- Added M4A to allowed file types and extensions
- Enhanced file type validation to check both MIME type and file extension
- Updated file input accept attribute to include M4A files

**Audio Processing:**
- Enhanced Waveform component to detect and use correct MIME type
- Added audioFile prop to pass file metadata for proper MIME type detection
- Improved blob creation with correct MIME type for M4A files

### Files Modified
- `src/app/performance/[id]/page.tsx` - Enhanced file validation and input
- `src/components/Waveform.tsx` - Added MIME type detection
- `FEATURES.md` - Updated documentation

### Testing
- M4A files now upload and process correctly
- Waveform visualization works with M4A files
- BPM detection works with M4A files
- All audio processing features work with M4A format

### Prevention
When adding new audio format support, always update both file validation and MIME type detection in the audio processing pipeline.

## "Failed to create performance" Error

### Problem
Console error "Failed to create performance" when uploading audio files in the performance editor.

### Root Cause
The file upload logic was incorrectly trying to create a new performance instead of adding a track to the existing performance. The batch creation API was being called with the wrong data structure.

### Solution
Fixed the file upload logic by:

**API Structure:**
- Created separate endpoints for track and notes creation
- `/api/performances/[id]/track` - Creates track for existing performance
- `/api/performances/[id]/notes` - Creates count notes for existing performance

**File Upload Logic:**
- Split the batch creation into two separate API calls
- First creates the track, then creates the notes
- Proper error handling for each step
- Maintains existing performance data

### Files Modified
- `src/app/performance/[id]/page.tsx` - Fixed file upload logic
- `src/app/api/performances/[id]/track/route.ts` - New track creation endpoint
- `src/app/api/performances/[id]/notes/route.ts` - New notes creation endpoint

### Testing
- File upload now works correctly without "Failed to create performance" error
- Tracks are properly created and associated with existing performances
- Count notes are generated and saved correctly
- All audio processing features work as expected

### Prevention
When working with existing resources, use update/create endpoints rather than batch creation endpoints that expect new resources.

## Track Creation API Issues

### Problem
"Failed to create track" error when uploading audio files, preventing waveform and count grid from displaying.

### Root Cause
The track creation API was failing due to schema validation issues and missing performanceId in the request body.

### Solution
Fixed the track creation API by:

**API Endpoint Fixes:**
- Added performanceId to request body in the API endpoint
- Enhanced error handling with detailed error messages
- Fixed schema validation for track creation

**Frontend Logic:**
- Removed performanceId from frontend request (added in API)
- Added proper await for loadPerformance after upload
- Added debugging logs to track data loading

### Files Modified
- `src/app/api/performances/[id]/track/route.ts` - Fixed performanceId handling
- `src/app/performance/[id]/page.tsx` - Enhanced error handling and debugging

### Testing
- Track creation API now works correctly
- Performance data loads properly after upload
- Waveform and count grid display correctly
- All audio processing features work as expected

### Prevention
Always ensure API endpoints handle required fields properly and add comprehensive error handling with detailed error messages.
